## 01 - There are several steps to building a strong foundation in data engineering:

Learn the basics of programming, such as loops, variables, and data structures, using a language such as Python or Java.

Learn SQL and become proficient in using it to query and manipulate data in a relational database.

Learn how to use big data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark to process and analyze large datasets.

Learn how to use cloud-based data storage and processing services, such as Amazon S3 and AWS Glue, to build scalable and reliable data pipelines.

Learn how to use data visualization tools, such as Tableau or Power BI, to create interactive visualizations of your data.

Learn how to use machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow, to build and deploy models that can be used to make predictions or identify patterns in your data.

Learn how to use containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and manage your data pipeline in a production environment.

Lastly, continue learning by keeping an eye on new technologies, reading blogs and articles, and participating in online communities to stay current on best practices and industry trends.
